    <h1>OnlineGDB Compiler</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      GDB or GNU Debugger is GNU project which helps to debug software
      applications and analyze what is happening during program execution.
    </p>
    <ul>
      It helps to:
      <li>investigate improper behavior of your program.</li>
      <li>
        find cause of logical error which is hard to find just by looking at
        source code.
      </li>
      <li>analyze crash occuring in your application.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How GDP help?</h2>
    <p>GDB gives you control over your program execution.</p>
    <ul>
      You can:
      <li>stop/pause program execution by specifying conditions.</li>
      <li>
        when your program is paused, you can analyse state of program, check
        values of variables and registers
      </li>
      <li>
        change values of variables/registers to see the impact on program
        behavior and this you can do without modifying source code
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So GDB is not some magic spell which will debug your program automatically
      but Its weapon which you can use to find out cause of bug.
    </p>
    <h2>Supported Programming Languages</h2>
    <p>
      Currently GDB supports C, C++, D, Go, Objective-C, Fortran, Java, OpenCL
      C, Pascal, assembly, Modula-2, and Ada languages. Now you would have brief
      idea about what is GDB and how it can be your savior when something goes
      wrong in your program.
